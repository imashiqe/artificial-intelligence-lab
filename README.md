# Artificial Intelligence Lab

This repository contains experiments, notes, and implementations related to **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** using **Python**.

## 📌 What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence is the study and design of computer systems that can **acquire, apply knowledge, perceive their environment, and act intelligently**. It can be broadly categorized into:

1. Systems that think like humans.
2. Systems that think rationally.
3. Systems that act like humans.
4. Systems that act rationally (Intelligent Agents).

## 📖 Why Study AI?

* To understand how machines can simulate human intelligence.
* To build intelligent agents that can perceive, learn, and act in real-world environments.
* To automate decision-making and problem-solving in various domains.

## 🤖 Intelligent Agents

An **agent** is anything that perceives its environment through **sensors** and acts upon that environment through **actuators**.

* Example: Humans (eyes, ears → hands, speech)
* Example: Robots (cameras, sensors → motors, actuators)
* Example: Thermostat (temperature sensor → switch)

## ⚙️ Applications of AI

* Robotics (self-driving cars, industrial robots)
* Natural Language Processing (machine translation, chatbots)
* Computer Vision (image recognition, medical imaging)
* Expert Systems (medical diagnosis, decision-making)
* Game Playing (chess, Go)
* Search Engines (Google, Bing)

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages

This lab will use **Python** as the primary programming language along with popular AI/ML libraries such as:

* `numpy`
* `pandas`
* `scikit-learn`
* `tensorflow` / `pytorch`
* `matplotlib`

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/imashiqe/artificial-intelligence-lab.git
cd artificial-intelligence-lab
```

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
